# NGO
Designed and developed a user-friendly, responsive website for NGO using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The goal of the website is to create a digital platform that effectively communicates the mission, engages visitors, and encourages support through donations, volunteer opportunities, and resource sharing.


Integration of "Donate Now" Button with Stripe API- To streamline the donation process, implemented a "Donate Now" button integrated with Stripeâ€™s API. This allows users to make secure payments directly from the site while providing a seamless checkout experience.
